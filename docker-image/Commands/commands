# Stop the container 
docker-compose stop goapp

# Start it again
docker-compose start goapp

# Or stop and recreate it
docker-compose stop goapp
docker-compose rm goapp
docker-compose up -d goapp

This will stop the running container, remove it, and recreate it - which is useful if you want a clean restart.



If you need to rebuild the image (eg after changing code), you would run:
# Rebuild 
docker-compose build goapp

# Restart with rebuilt image
docker-compose up -d --no-deps goapp

docker-compose up -d --build --no-deps goapp
